(C++, OpenGL) Final project for an undergraduate OpenGL class. Wander the void of space and compete with other autonomous pirates for precious grog. Your reputation precedes you: destroy a number of enemies and pirates you encounter will decide to join your fleet rather than fight. But beware: other pirates are doing the same, and their fleets won’t hesitate to blow you to smithereens for your grog.
